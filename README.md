# HOTEL-BOOKING-PREDICTION-USING-ML

This project is aimed at building a machine learning model to predict hotel booking cancellations. It utilizes a dataset containing various features related to hotel bookings, customer information, and booking details. The goal is to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not, which can be valuable for hotel management and resource planning.

The goal is to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not based on various features and historical booking data. Here's an outline of the steps you can follow to create a basic machine learning model for this task:

1.	Data Collection: Gather the necessary data for your hotel bookings. This dataset should include features such as the customer's demographics, booking information, time of booking, room type, etc., as well as the target variable indicating whether the booking was canceled or not.

2.	Data Preprocessing: Clean the data and handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Convert categorical features into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding.

3.	Data Splitting: Split your dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the machine learning model, while the test set will be used to evaluate its performance.

4.	Select a Model: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for binary classification. Common choices include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Gradient Boosting algorithms.

5.	Model Training: Fit your selected model to the training data using the fit() method.

6.	Model Evaluation: Use the test data to evaluate the model's performance. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure how well your model predicts hotel booking cancellations.

7.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune your model by optimizing hyperparameters through techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

8.	Predictions: Once you have a well-performing model, you can use it to make predictions on new data.
